/**
 * Relational databases accessed by SQL (Structured Query Language). You can use
 * SQL when interacting with relational databases where data is stored in tables
 * that have fixed columns and rows.
 * 
 * SQL databases rose in popularity in the early 1970s. At the time, storage was
 * extremely expensive, so software engineers normalized their databases in
 * order to reduce data duplication.
 * 
 * Software engineers in the 1970s also commonly followed the waterfall software
 * development model. Projects were planned in detail before development began.
 * Software engineers painstakingly created complex entity-relationship (E-R)
 * diagrams to ensure they had carefully thought through all the data they would
 * need to store. Due to this upfront planning model, software engineers
 * struggled to adapt if requirements changed during the development cycle. As a
 * result, projects frequently went over budget, exceeded deadlines and failed
 * to deliver against user needs.

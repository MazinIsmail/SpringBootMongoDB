 * NoSQL
 * 
 * NoSQL databases ("not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently
 * than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on
 * their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and
 * graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of
 * data and high user loads.
 * 
 * When people use the term “NoSQL database”, they typically use it to refer to
 * any non-relational database. Some say the term “NoSQL” stands for “non SQL”
 * while others say it stands for “not only SQL.” Either way, most agree that
 * NoSQL databases are databases that store data in a format other than
 * relational tables.
 * 
 * A common misconception is that NoSQL databases or non-relational databases
 * don’t store relationship data well. NoSQL databases can store relationship
 * data—they just store it differently than relational databases do. In fact,
 * when compared with SQL databases, many find modeling relationship data in
 * NoSQL databases to be easier than in SQL databases, because related data
 * doesn’t have to be split between tables.
 * 
 * NoSQL data models allow related data to be nested within a single data
 * structure.
 * 
 * NoSQL databases emerged in the late 2000s as the cost of storage dramatically
 * decreased. Gone were the days of needing to create a complex,
 * difficult-to-manage data model simply for the purposes of reducing data
 * duplication. Developers (rather than storage) were becoming the primary cost
 * of software development, so NoSQL databases optimized for developer
 * productivity.
 * 
 * As storage costs rapidly decreased, the amount of data applications needed to
 * store and query increased. This data came in all shapes and sizes—structured,
 * semistructured, and polymorphic—and defining the schema in advance became
 * nearly impossible. NoSQL databases allow developers to store huge amounts of
 * unstructured data, giving them a lot of flexibility.
 * 
 * Additionally, the Agile Manifesto was rising in popularity, and software
 * engineers were rethinking the way they developed software. They were
 * recognizing the need to rapidly adapt to changing requirements. They needed
 * the ability to iterate quickly and make changes throughout their software
 * stack—all the way down to the database model. NoSQL databases gave them this
 * flexibility.
 * 
 * Cloud computing also rose in popularity, and developers began using public
 * clouds to host their applications and data. They wanted the ability to
 * distribute data across multiple servers and regions to make their
 * applications resilient, to scale-out instead of scale-up, and to intelligent
 * geo-place their data. Some NoSQL databases like MongoDB provided these
 * capabilities.

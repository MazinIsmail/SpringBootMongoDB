/**
 * Scaling Strategies
 * 
 * NoSQL databases were all created to deliver high performance. Usually this is
 * achieved through a combination of serving queries from data that is in-memory
 * and using a scale-out strategy that serves a database from a cluster of
 * smaller computers.
 * 
 * Each of the types of NoSQL databases use different combinations of these two
 * strategies.
 * 
 * Most NoSQL databases have used the cloud to automate the expansion and
 * contraction of clusters.
 * 
 * All versions of MongoDB are based on a cluster of computers, offering
 * inherent support for high-availability. MongoDB also supports sharding of
 * data across clusters to increase performance. MongoDB Atlas, the cloud
 * version of MongoDB, offers a variety of cluster sizes, some of which can be
 * scaled up and down automatically.

/**
 * Deployment Options
 * 
 * While the public cloud has become an exciting and convenient way to deploy a
 * database as a service (DBaaS), most computing still takes place on-premise.
 * 
 * Having the flexibility to deploy on-premise or in the cloud in a self-managed
 * way as well as via a DBaaS model on any public cloud provides the ultimate
 * flexibility.
 * 
 * In addition, many users of NoSQL databases will want full commercial support.
 * 
 * Each NoSQL database has a different combination of such offerings.
 * 
 * MongoDB supports all deployment models, self-managed on premise or in the
 * cloud and DBaaS on all public clouds. MongoDB offers commercial support for
 * its enterprise edition and for MongoDB Atlas, its DBaaS.
